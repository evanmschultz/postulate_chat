Explanation:
/models: This is where you place your data models and utility classes. Each model gets its own file, making it easier to find and modify a specific model. For instance, user.py could contain the User model, and chat.py could contain the Chat model.

/services: This is where the business logic goes. Each service gets its own file as well. The services interact with the models and perform operations that are more complex. For example, user_service.py could handle user authentication, and chat_service.py could handle message sending and retrieval.

/templates and /static: These folders are for your HTML templates and static files like CSS and JavaScript, respectively. Since you're learning front-end technologies like React and NextJS, you might eventually replace or supplement this with a more complex front-end setup.

views.py and controllers.py: These files act as your controllers in the MVC architecture. They handle incoming HTTP requests, interact with the models and services, and return HTTP responses (often by rendering HTML templates).

By structuring your project this way, you're setting yourself up for better maintainability and scalability, both of which are essential for AI projects and startups.
