This notebook showcases an agent designed to retrieve information from one or more vectorstores, either with or without sources. First, we'll create an agent with a single vectorstore. We can also easily use this initialize an agent with multiple vectorstores and use the agent to route between them. To do this. This agent is optimized for routing, so it is a different toolkit and initializer.
