Amazon Kendra is an intelligent search service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to enable powerful search capabilities across various data sources within an organization. Kendra is designed to help users find the information they need quickly and accurately, improving productivity and decision-making. arXiv is an open-access archive for 2 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. Azure Cognitive Search (formerly known as Azure Search) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. BM25 also known as the Okapi BM25, is a ranking function used in information retrieval systems to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. Chaindesk platform brings data from anywhere (Datsources: Text, PDF, Word, PowerPpoint, Excel, Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets, etc..) into Datastores (container of multiple Datasources). OpenAI plugins connect ChatGPT to third-party applications. These plugins enable ChatGPT to interact with APIs defined by developers, enhancing ChatGPT's capabilities and allowing it to perform a wide range of actions. Cohere is a Canadian startup that provides natural language processing models that help companies improve human-machine interactions. DocArray is a versatile, open-source tool for managing your multi-modal data. It lets you shape your data however you want, and offers the flexibility to store and search it using various document index backends. Plus, it gets even better - you can utilize your DocArray document index to create a DocArrayRetriever, and build awesome Langchain apps! Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Enterprise Search is a part of the Generative AI App Builder suite of tools offered by Google Cloud. This notebook covers how to retrieve documents from Google Drive. In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric supervised learning method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification and regression. Lord of the Retrievers, also known as MergerRetriever, takes a list of retrievers as input and merges the results of their getrelevantdocuments() methods into a single list. The merged results will be a list of documents that are relevant to the query and that have been ranked by the different retrievers. Metal is a managed service for ML Embeddings. Pinecone is a vector database with broad functionality. PubMed¬Æ by The National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine comprises more than 35 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Citations may include links to full text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites. Simple retriever that applies an LLM between the user input and the query pass the to retriever. Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. TF-IDF means term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. Vespa is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query. Weaviate is an open source vector database. Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. Retriever Example for Zep - A long-term memory store for LLM applications.
