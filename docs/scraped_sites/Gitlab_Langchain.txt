The Gitlab toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a gitlab repository. The tool is a wrapper for the python-gitlab library.  Each of these steps will be explained in greate detail below. Get Issues- fetches issues from the repository. Get Issue- feteches details about a specific issue. Comment on Issue- posts a comment on a specific issue. Create Pull Request- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch. Create File- creates a new file in the repository. Read File- reads a file from the repository. Update File- updates a file in the repository. Delete File- deletes a file from the repository. Follow the instructions here to create a Gitlab personal access token. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions: Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set: IntegrationsCallbacksChat modelsChat loadersDocument loadersDocument transformersLLMsMemoryRetrieversText embedding modelsAgents & ToolkitsAINetworkAirbyte Question AnsweringAmadeusAzure Cognitive ServicesCSVDocument ComparisonGithubGitlabGmailGoogle Drive toolJiraJSONMultiOnOffice365OpenAPINatural Language APIsPandas DataframePlayWright BrowserPowerBI DatasetPythonSpark DataframeSpark SQLSQL DatabaseVectorstoreXorbitsToolsVector storesGrouped by provider Callbacks Chat models Chat loaders Document loaders Document transformers LLMs Memory Retrievers Text embedding models Agents & ToolkitsAINetworkAirbyte Question AnsweringAmadeusAzure Cognitive ServicesCSVDocument ComparisonGithubGitlabGmailGoogle Drive toolJiraJSONMultiOnOffice365OpenAPINatural Language APIsPandas DataframePlayWright BrowserPowerBI DatasetPythonSpark DataframeSpark SQLSQL DatabaseVectorstoreXorbits AINetwork Airbyte Question Answering Amadeus Azure Cognitive Services CSV Document Comparison Github Gitlab Gmail Google Drive tool Jira JSON MultiOn Office365 OpenAPI Natural Language APIs Pandas Dataframe PlayWright Browser PowerBI Dataset Python Spark Dataframe Spark SQL SQL Database Vectorstore Xorbits Tools Vector stores Grouped by provider  Integrations Agents & Toolkits Gitlab Install the python-gitlab library Create a Gitlab personal access token Set your environmental variables Pass the tools to your agent with toolkit.get_tools() Get Issues- fetches issues from the repository.
