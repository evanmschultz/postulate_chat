This covers how to use WebBaseLoader to load all text from HTML webpages into a document format that we can use downstream. For more custom logic for loading webpages look at some child class examples such as IMSDbLoader, AZLyricsLoader, and CollegeConfidentialLoader To bypass SSL verification errors during fetching, you can set the "verify" option: loader.requests_kwargs = {'verify':False} You can also load multiple webpages at once by passing in a list of urls to the loader. This will return a list of documents in the same order as the urls passed in. You can speed up the scraping process by scraping and parsing multiple urls concurrently. There are reasonable limits to concurrent requests, defaulting to 2 per second.  If you aren't concerned about being a good citizen, or you control the server you are scraping and don't care about load, you can change the requests_per_second parameter to increase the max concurrent requests.  Note, while this will speed up the scraping process, but may cause the server to block you.  Be careful! You can also look at SitemapLoader for an example of how to load a sitemap file, which is an example of using this feature. Sometimes you might need to use proxies to get around IP blocks. You can pass in a dictionary of proxies to the loader (and requests underneath) to use them.
