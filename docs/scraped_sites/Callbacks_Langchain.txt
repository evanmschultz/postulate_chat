Argilla - Open-source data platform for LLMs DeepEval package for unit testing LLMs. Context - User Analytics for LLM Powered Products This example shows how one can track the following while calling OpenAI models via LangChain and Infino: Label Studio is an open-source data labeling platform that provides LangChain with flexibility when it comes to labeling data for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). It also enables the preparation of custom training data and the collection and evaluation of responses through human feedback. LLMonitor is an open-source observability platform that provides cost and usage analytics, user tracking, tracing and evaluation tools. PromptLayer Streamlit is a faster way to build and share data apps.
