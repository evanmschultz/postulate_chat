There are many 1000s of Gradio apps on Hugging Face Spaces. This library puts them at the tips of your LLM's fingers 🦾 GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. Huggingface Tools that supporting text I/O can be Human are AGI so they can certainly be used as a tool to help out AI agent This notebook shows how to use IFTTT Webhooks. Lemon Agent helps you build powerful AI assistants in minutes and automate workflows by allowing for accurate and reliable read and write operations in tools like Airtable, Hubspot, Discord, Notion, Slack and Github. Metaphor is a search engine fully designed to be used by LLMs. You can search and then get the contents for any page. Nuclia automatically indexes your unstructured data from any internal and external source, providing optimized search results and generative answers. It can handle video and audio transcription, image content extraction, and document parsing. This notebook goes over how to use the OpenWeatherMap component to fetch weather information. PubMed® comprises more than 35 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Citations may include links to full text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites. The web contains a lot of information that LLMs do not have access to. In order to easily let LLMs interact with that information, we provide a wrapper around the Python Requests module that takes in a URL and fetches data from that URL. SceneXplain is an ImageCaptioning service accessible through the SceneXplain Tool. This notebook shows off usage of various search tools. This notebook goes over how to use a self hosted SearxNG search API to search the web. This notebook goes over how to use the SerpAPI component to search the web. This notebook goes over how to use the Twilio API wrapper to send a message through SMS or Twilio Messaging Channels. Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki.
