Alpha Vantage Alpha Vantage provides realtime and historical financial market data through a set of powerful and developer-friendly data APIs and spreadsheets. This notebook shows how to use the Apify integration for LangChain. This notebook goes over how to use the arxiv tool with an agent. Amazon AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It helps developers to build and run applications and services without provisioning or managing servers. This serverless architecture enables you to focus on writing and deploying code, while AWS automatically takes care of scaling, patching, and managing the infrastructure required to run your applications. Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment). This notebook goes over how to use the bing search component. This notebook goes over how to use the Brave Search tool. This example shows how to use ChatGPT Plugins within LangChain abstractions. This notebook shows how you can generate images from a prompt synthesized using an OpenAI LLM. The images are generated using Dall-E, which uses the same OpenAI API key as the LLM. This notebook demonstrates how to use the DataForSeo API to obtain search engine results. The DataForSeo API retrieves SERP from most popular search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo. It also allows to get SERPs from different search engine types like Maps, News, Events, etc. This notebook goes over how to use the duck-duck-go search component. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use Eden AI tools with an Agent. LangChain provides tools for interacting with a local file system out of the box. This notebook walks through some of them. Golden provides a set of natural language APIs for querying and enrichment using the Golden Knowledge Graph e.g. queries such as: Products from OpenAI, Generative ai companies with series a funding, and rappers who invest can be used to retrieve structured data about relevant entities. This notebook walks through connecting a LangChain to the Google Drive API. This notebook goes through how to use Google Places API This notebook goes over how to use the google search component. This notebook goes over how to use the Google Serper component to search the web. First you need to sign up for a free account at serper.dev and get your api key. There are many 1000s of Gradio apps on Hugging Face Spaces. This library puts them at the tips of your LLM's fingers ü¶æ GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. Huggingface Tools that supporting text I/O can be Human are AGI so they can certainly be used as a tool to help out AI agent This notebook shows how to use IFTTT Webhooks. Lemon Agent helps you build powerful AI assistants in minutes and automate workflows by allowing for accurate and reliable read and write operations in tools like Airtable, Hubspot, Discord, Notion, Slack and Github. Metaphor is a search engine fully designed to be used by LLMs. You can search and then get the contents for any page. Nuclia automatically indexes your unstructured data from any internal and external source, providing optimized search results and generative answers. It can handle video and audio transcription, image content extraction, and document parsing. This notebook goes over how to use the OpenWeatherMap component to fetch weather information. PubMed¬Æ comprises more than 35 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Citations may include links to full text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites. The web contains a lot of information that LLMs do not have access to. In order to easily let LLMs interact with that information, we provide a wrapper around the Python Requests module that takes in a URL and fetches data from that URL. SceneXplain is an ImageCaptioning service accessible through the SceneXplain Tool. This notebook shows off usage of various search tools. This notebook goes over how to use a self hosted SearxNG search API to search the web. This notebook goes over how to use the SerpAPI component to search the web. This notebook goes over how to use the Twilio API wrapper to send a message through SMS or Twilio Messaging Channels. Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. This notebook goes over how to use the wolfram alpha component. This notebook goes over how to use the yahoofinancenews tool with an agent. YouTube Search package searches YouTube videos avoiding using their heavily rate-limited API. Zapier Natural Language Actions gives you access to the 5k+ apps, 20k+ actions on Zapier's platform through a natural language API interface.
