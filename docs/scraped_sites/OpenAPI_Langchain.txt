We can construct agents to consume arbitrary APIs, here APIs conformant to the OpenAPI/Swagger specification. In this example, we'll consider an approach called hierarchical planning, common in robotics and appearing in recent works for LLMs X robotics. We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API. The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them. In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :) We'll work with the Spotify API as one of the examples of a somewhat complex API. There's a bit of auth-related setup to do if you want to replicate this. Starting with GPT-4. (Some robustness iterations under way for GPT-3 family.) Takes awhile to get there! Here's an agent that's not particularly practical, but neat! The agent has access to 2 toolkits. One comprises tools to interact with json: one tool to list the keys of a json object and another tool to get the value for a given key. The other toolkit comprises requests wrappers to send GET and POST requests. This agent consumes a lot calls to the language model, but does a surprisingly decent job.

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

The agent has access to 2 toolkits. One comprises tools to interact with json: one tool to list the keys of a json object and another tool to get the value for a given key. The other toolkit comprises requests wrappers to send GET and POST requests. This agent consumes a lot calls to the language model, but does a surprisingly decent job.from langchain.agents import create_openapi_agentfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import OpenAPIToolkitfrom langchain.llms.openai import OpenAIfrom langchain.requests import TextRequestsWrapperfrom langchain.tools.json.tool import JsonSpecAPI Reference:create_openapi_agentOpenAPIToolkitOpenAITextRequestsWrapperJsonSpecwith open("openai_openapi.yaml") as f:    data = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)json_spec = JsonSpec(dict_=data, max_value_length=4000)openapi_toolkit = OpenAPIToolkit.from_llm(    OpenAI(temperature=0), json_spec, openai_requests_wrapper, verbose=True)openapi_agent_executor = create_openapi_agent(    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), toolkit=openapi_toolkit, verbose=True)openapi_agent_executor.run(    "Make a post request to openai /completions.

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a "planner" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a "controller" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There's a lot left to get this working very robustly :)To start, let's collect some OpenAPI specs.​import os, yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml openai_openapi.yamlwget https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docsmv api-docs klarna_openapi.yamlwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/main/APIs/spotify.com/1.0.0/openapi.yamlmv openapi.yaml spotify_openapi.yaml    --2023-03-31 15:45:56--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-openapi/master/openapi.yaml    Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.110.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.111.133, ...

This agent consumes a lot calls to the language model, but does a surprisingly decent job.from langchain.agents import create_openapi_agentfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import OpenAPIToolkitfrom langchain.llms.openai import OpenAIfrom langchain.requests import TextRequestsWrapperfrom langchain.tools.json.tool import JsonSpecAPI Reference:create_openapi_agentOpenAPIToolkitOpenAITextRequestsWrapperJsonSpecwith open("openai_openapi.yaml") as f:    data = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)json_spec = JsonSpec(dict_=data, max_value_length=4000)openapi_toolkit = OpenAPIToolkit.from_llm(    OpenAI(temperature=0), json_spec, openai_requests_wrapper, verbose=True)openapi_agent_executor = create_openapi_agent(    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), toolkit=openapi_toolkit, verbose=True)openapi_agent_executor.run(    "Make a post request to openai /completions.
