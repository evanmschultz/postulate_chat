Documents used in a vector store knowledge base are typically stored in narrative or conversational format. However, most user queries are in question format. If we convert documents into Q&A format before vectorizing them, we can increase the liklihood of retrieving relevant documents, and decrease the liklihood of retrieving irrelevant documents. We can accomplish this using the Doctran library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to "interrogate" documents. See this notebook for benchmarks on vector similarity scores for various queries based on raw documents versus interrogated documents. This is the document we'll interrogate After interrogating a document, the result will be returned as a new document with questions and answers provided in the metadata.
