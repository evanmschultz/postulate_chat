This notebook covers how to get started with Anthropic chat models. This notebook shows how to use an experimental wrapper around Anthropic that gives it the same API as OpenAI Functions. This notebook demonstrates the use of langchain.chat_models.ChatAnyscale for Anyscale Endpoints. This notebook goes over how to connect to an Azure hosted OpenAI endpoint AzureML is a platform used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Users can explore the types of models to deploy in the Model Catalog, which provides Azure Foundation Models and OpenAI Models. Azure Foundation Models include various open-source models and popular Hugging Face models. Users can also import models of their liking into AzureML. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case ERNIE-Bot is a large language model developed by Baidu, covering a huge amount of Chinese data. Note: This is seperate from the Google PaLM integration. Google has chosen to offer an enterprise version of PaLM through GCP, and this supports the models made available through there. This notebook covers how to get started with JinaChat chat models. Konko API is a fully managed Web API designed to help application developers: LiteLLM is a library that simplifies calling Anthropic, Azure, Huggingface, Replicate, etc. This notebook shows how to use LangChain with LlamaAPI - a hosted version of Llama2 that adds in support for function calling. Ollama allows you to run open-source large language models, such as LLaMA2, locally. This notebook covers how to get started with OpenAI chat models. This example showcases how to connect to PromptLayer to start recording your ChatOpenAI requests.
