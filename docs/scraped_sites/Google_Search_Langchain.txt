This notebook goes over how to use the google search component. First, you need to set up the proper API keys and environment variables. To set it up, create the GOOGLE_API_KEY in the Google Cloud credential console (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and a GOOGLE_CSE_ID using the Programmable Search Engine (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create). Next, it is good to follow the instructions found here. Then we will need to set some environment variables. You can use the k parameter to set the number of results 'The official home of the Python Programming Language.' Run query through GoogleSearch and return snippet, title, and link metadata.
