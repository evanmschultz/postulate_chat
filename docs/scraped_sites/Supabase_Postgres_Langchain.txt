Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. Supabase is built on top of PostgreSQL, which offers strong SQL querying capabilities and enables a simple interface with already-existing tools and frameworks. PostgreSQL also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. This notebook shows how to use Supabase and pgvector as your VectorStore. To run this notebook, please ensure: The following function determines cosine similarity, but you can adjust to your needs. We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better. This section goes over different options for how to use SupabaseVectorStore as a retriever. In addition to using similarity search in the retriever object, you can also use mmr.

One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.        ## Document 1        One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from ‚Äúburn pits‚Äù that incinerated wastes of war‚Äîmedical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.         When they came home, many of the world‚Äôs fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.         Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness.         A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.         I know.         One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.         We don‚Äôt know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.         But I‚Äôm committed to finding out everything we can.         Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.         The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.          He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.         Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.         Heath‚Äôs widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.        ## Document 2        And I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.         Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.          America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.          These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming.         But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.         When the history of this era is written Putin‚Äôs war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.         While it shouldn‚Äôt have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what‚Äôs at stake now everyone sees it clearly.        ## Document 3        We can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.         I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.         They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.         Officer Mora was 27 years old.         Officer Rivera was 22.         Both Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.         I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.         I‚Äôve worked on these issues a long time.         I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who‚Äôll walk the beat, who‚Äôll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.PreviousStarRocksNextTairSimilarity search with scoreRetriever optionsMaximal Marginal Relevance SearchesCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright ¬© 2023 LangChain, Inc.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.          These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming.         But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.         They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.         Officer Mora was 27 years old.         Officer Rivera was 22.         Both Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.         I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

When they came home, many of the world‚Äôs fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.         Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness.         A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.         I know.         One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.         We don‚Äôt know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.         But I‚Äôm committed to finding out everything we can.         Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.         The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.          He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.         Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.         Heath‚Äôs widow Danielle is here with us tonight.

And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.         Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.          America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.          These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming.         But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.         I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.         They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.         Officer Mora was 27 years old.         Officer Rivera was 22.         Both Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.         I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.         I‚Äôve worked on these issues a long time.         I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who‚Äôll walk the beat, who‚Äôll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.PreviousStarRocksNextTair IntegrationsVector storesSupabase (Postgres)On this pageSupabase (Postgres)Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative.

When they came home, many of the world‚Äôs fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.         Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness.         A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.         I know.         One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.         We don‚Äôt know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.         But I‚Äôm committed to finding out everything we can.
