Weaviate is an open source vector database. Hybrid search is a technique that combines multiple search algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. It uses the best features of both keyword-based search algorithms with vector search techniques. The Hybrid search in Weaviate uses sparse and dense vectors to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents. This notebook shows how to use Weaviate hybrid search as a LangChain retriever.
