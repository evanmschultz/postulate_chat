This notebook walks you through connecting LangChain to the Amadeus travel information API To use this toolkit, you will need to set up your credentials explained in the Amadeus for developers getting started overview. Once you've received a AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID and AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET, you can input them as environmental variables below. The toolkit will read the AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID and AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET environmental variables to authenticate the user so you need to set them here. You will also need to set your OPENAI_API_KEY to use the agent later. To start, you need to create the toolkit, so you can access its tools later.
